This README file describes the set of clustertools that have been developed for
the convenient interaction with the cluster queues and job outputs.

q-usage
=================================================

This is one of the most usefull wrappers, as it gives a short overview of the
current job situation on the cluster. Technically, it is a wrapper for the
q-status command decribed further below.

Usage: q-usage
When called without arguments, it provides a summary of the currently running,
held and queued jobs of all users. If any of the thre categories should be
empty, no information for this category is displayed.

Usage: q-usage <user>
When called with a user-ID as argument, the summary is shown for the respective 
user only. 


q-less
=================================================

This script takes the output-file from a running job and dsiplays it using less.
If a job has no output file defined or runs interactively, en error will occur:
For this to work, is required that the output file is directly spooled to the
designed output location (see torque option -k).

Usage: q-less <job-id>


q-tail
=================================================

This script takes the output-file of a running job and tails its content to the
screen. It's behavior is equivalent to tail -f <File>. 
For this to work, is required that the output file is directly spooled to the
designed output location (see torque option -k).

Usage: q-tail <job-id>


qlogin
=================================================

This is a wrapper script for requesting a node for interactive work using the
active q. When called without any arguments, it will request a node with
standard settings (1 cpu, 1gb, 72h). Each of the options can be customized.

Usage: qlogin [-m <mem>] [--mem=<mem>] [-n <ncpus>] [<additional params in
              torque format>] 

q-status
=================================================

This wrapper gets its information from showq and is mainly used as basis for
q-usage. For more detailed information, please refer to the help page that can
be invoked by q-status -h.


q-gstat
=================================================
This is formatting wrapper around pbsnodes, summarizing cpu load and memory
load of all available nodes. Help page is available via q-gstat -h. Run without
arguments it shows the standard overview of the cluster state.


q-user
=================================================
A wrapper of q-stat that gives an overview of which user has how many jobs running
on which node. Help available via -h. Run without arguments it shows how many jobs 
the invoking user is running. To display information for all users, use 'all' instead
of user name.
